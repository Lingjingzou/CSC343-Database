    * request has a source location in this area), dispatches drivers to them
    * one at a time, from the client with the highest total billings down
    * to the client with the lowest total billings, or until there are no
    * more drivers available.
    *
    * Only drivers who (a) have declared that they are available and have 
    * not since then been dispatched, and (b) whose location is in the area
    * bounded by NW and SE, are dispatched.  If there are several to choose
    * from, the one closest to the client's source location is chosen.
    * In the case of ties, any one of the tied drivers may be dispatched.
    *
    * Area boundaries are inclusive.  For example, the point (4.0, 10.0) 
    * is considered within the area defined by 
    *         NW = (1.0, 10.0) and SE = (25.0, 2.0) 
    * even though it is right at the upper boundary of the area.
    *
    * Dispatching a driver is accomplished by adding a row to the
    * Dispatch table.  All dispatching that results from a call to this
    * method is recorded to have happened at the same time, which is
    * passed through parameter 'when'.

    * @param  NW    x, y coordinates in the northwest corner of this area.
